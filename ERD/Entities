To design the database for the ZenClass Portal, we'll define the entities and their relationships using an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD). The entities and their attributes are as follows:

1.Users (candidate, mentor)

user_id (Primary Key)
name
email
role (candidate, mentor)

2.Classes

class_id (Primary Key)
title
timing
isEnded

3.Tasks

task_id (Primary Key)
title
tag

4.Queries

query_id (Primary Key)
title
description
tag
date
language
time

5.Events

event_id (Primary Key)
title
type (Hackathon, Any placement session)
date
location

*****************************************************

Linking Tables
To relate these entities using linking tables:

User_Classes

user_class_id (Primary Key)
user_id (Foreign Key)
class_id (Foreign Key)

User_Tasks

user_task_id (Primary Key)
user_id (Foreign Key)
task_id (Foreign Key)

User_Queries

user_query_id (Primary Key)
user_id (Foreign Key)
query_id (Foreign Key)

User_Events

user_event_id (Primary Key)
user_id (Foreign Key)
event_id (Foreign Key)

Class_Tasks

class_task_id (Primary Key)
class_id (Foreign Key)
task_id (Foreign Key)

Class_Queries

class_query_id (Primary Key)
class_id (Foreign Key)
query_id (Foreign Key)

Let's create an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for these entities and their relationships.
